# Disease-Detection-using-Neural-Networks

In this project-based course, we will build, train and test a machine learning model to detect diabetes with Artificial Neural Networks and XG-boost.
The objective of this project is to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on their given features and diagnostic measurements such as number of pregnancies, insulin levels, Body mass index, age and blood pressure.
Following steps are covered:

Perform Data Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis

Build, Train and Test XG-Boost and Artificial Neural Networks Model to solve classification type problems

Evaluate trained model performance
